Hi there! 

Thank you for coming to here!

This is a "program" that hope to help different researcher or music lover to play their music!

So, you only have to download this project zip code, unzip it...

Then, please change to the location you are in (for example, Desktop/project...)

Later on, you just have to type python3 main.py

It will pop up the tab! Have fun!!
